# Overview
D7.5 presents the alpha versions of applications developed using the software prototypes, strategies, methodologies, and concepts from WP2-WP4, along with feedback for their improvement. This deliverable includes internal user manuals and represents a collaborative effort led by FZJ, culminating in the compilation of software for six WP7 applications.

# Repository Structure
This repository provides links to the applications' respective repositories. By maintaining the applications in their existing repositories, we ensure better long-term maintenance and usability of the tools developed under the ADMIRE project, even after the project's completion.
